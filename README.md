# ðŸŒ¦

a tiny weather app build with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)

> [!TIP]
>
> Use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for a faster Python development experience!
>
> Installation instructions below will assume you have this CLI tool installed.

## ðŸ§° Setup

<details>
  <summary>Prerequisites:</summary>

This repo uses Python and Node, and was scaffolded using the following tools.

#### Install `uv`

macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Windows:

```ps
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

#### Install `volta`

macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

Windows:

Download installer from [Volta Getting Started page](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started#windows-installation)

#### Install `node`

```bash
volta install node
```

#### Install `yarn`

```bash
volta install yarn
```

And you're good to go!

</details>

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your [api key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) from Open Weather Map to a key named `WEATHER_API_KEY=`

   macOS/Linux users can use this command to write the key to a new file:

   ```bash
   echo WEATHER_API_KEY=api_key_here > .env
   ```

   > [!WARNING]
   >
   > The above command will cause Flask to throw an error if run on a Windows machine. This is because Powershell uses a different default text encoding compared to macOS/Linux. If you run into this error, delete the file and manually create it as instructed!

1. Create a new local virtual environment:

   ```bash
   uv venv
   ```

1. Install project dependencies:

   Node:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

   Python:

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Activate virtual environment:

   ```bash
   yarn activate
   ```

1. And start developing!

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
